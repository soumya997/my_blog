<!-- # METRIC LEARNING 01: Introduction to Metric learning and Center Loss

This blog post is a first in a series of total 4 blog posts on **Metric learning**. When I first started to learn about metric learning, I couldn't find any blog posts that explained the concepts in detail along with code implementation. I wish to fill the gap through this series and in this series of 4 blog posts we will be looking at:

1. [Center Loss](https://kpzhang93.github.io/papers/eccv2016.pdf) 
2. [A-Softmax Loss (Sphereface Loss)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08063) 
3. [CosFace Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09414)
4. [ArcFace Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698)

We will understand the concepts in detail and also look at how to implement the above loss functions using PyTorch. 

In today's blog posts we will start with the basics of metric learning and also look at **Center Loss**. We look at what are closed-set and open-set problems and why metric learning is needed for open-set type problems. We also look at code-level implementations of Center Loss that helps reduce intra-class (items with same label are referred to as intra-class) variation. A complete working notebook along with code implementation has been shared [here](https://github.com/amaarora/amaarora.github.io/blob/master/nbs/Understanding%20Metric%20Learning.ipynb).

## What is metric learning and what are it's applications?
The most commonly used CNNs perform feature learning and label prediction, mapping the input data to deep features (the output of the last hidden layer), then to the predicted labels, as shown in Fig. 1 below.

In generic object, scene or action recognition, the classes of the possible testing samples are within the training set, which is also referred to close-set identification. Therefore, the predicted labels dominate the performance and Softmax Loss* is able to directly address the classification problems. In this way, the label prediction (the last fully connected layer) acts like a linear classifier and the deeply learned features are prone to be separable.

For face recognition task, the deeply learned features need to be not only separable but also discriminative. And, the deep features learned using Softmax Loss* are separable but not discriminative enough. With metric learning, the aim is to learn discriminative features as shown in Fig 1. above. Intuitively, minimizing the intra-class variations while keeping the features of different classes separable is the key.

***Softmax Loss:**
When I first started reading papers related to metric learning losses, I was confused about what is Softmax Loss? From what I knew, Softmax is an activation function but not a loss function. Well, Softmax Activation followed by Cross Entropy Loss is referred to as Softmax Loss in the literature.

For applications such as facial recognition and landmark recognition, since the number of classes is so large that is treating them as standard classification type problems doesn't work. In the recent [Google Landmark Recognition 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-2020) competition on Kaggle, the training set had 81,313 classes alone and using standard softmax loss and treating this as a standard classification leads to suboptimal results as the test set might have images that are outside the classes contained in training set. Such type of problems are referred to as open-set problems. Generally, we work with closed-set problems where the test images are part of the training set classes but in cases where the number of classes is so large such as in landark recognition or facial recognition, these are referred to as open-set problems and learning discrimative features is key for performing well in such type of challenges. 

As mentioned in the [Arcface paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07698), Softmax loss has some drawbacks:  
1. The size of the linear transformation matrix W ∈ R<sup>d×n</sup> increases linearly with the identities number n; 
2. The learned features are separable for the closed-set classification problem but not discriminative enough for the open-set recognition problem.

Therefore, several variants have been proposed to enhance the discriminative power of the softmax loss. And one such variant is the [Center Loss](https://kpzhang93.github.io/papers/eccv2016.pdf) which we will be looking at further down in this blog post.

## Need for a better loss function than Softmax Loss
Before we look at what Center Loss is, let's first understand the limitations with Softmax Loss. 

To understand the limitations, let's implement it on MNIST as a toy example.

The toy example has been presented in the notebook [here](https://github.com/amaarora/amaarora.github.io/blob/master/nbs/Understanding%20Metric%20Learning.ipynb). Mathematically, the Softmax Loss function can be represented as: 

![](/images/softmax_loss.png "eq-2 Softmax Loss")

If we plot the 2-dim features, we can look at the test set distribution as shown in the image from the paper below. 

![](/images/mnist_test_set.png "fig-2 MNIST test features w Softmax Loss")

We can observe that: 
1. Under the supervision of softmax loss, the deeply learned features are separable.
2. The deep features are not discriminative enough, since they still show significant intra-class variations.

Therefore, it is not suitable to use these features directly for recognition. And we are after discriminative features as in Fig 1.

## Center Loss: Introduction
In this paper, the authors introduced a new loss function, namely **Center Loss**, to efficiently
enhance the discriminative power of the deeply learned features in neural networks. Specifically, the idea is to learn a center (a vector with the same dimension as a feature) for deep features of each class.

From the paper, 
> In the course of training, we simultaneously update the center and minimize the distances between the deep features and their corresponding class centers. The CNNs are trained under the joint supervision of the softmax loss and center loss, with a hyper parameter to balance the two supervision signals. Intuitively, the softmax loss forces the deep features of different classes staying apart. The center loss efficiently pulls the deep features of the same class to their centers.

### A simple example on how to calculate class centers
To understand the center loss simply, let's look at an example below:

![](/images/center_loss.jpg "fig-3 Center Loss Explained")

Let's assume we have 5 input images, 3 of `cat` and 2 of label `dog`. We pass it through a neural network to get 512 dimension vector outputs (or a n-dim vector). Next, we take average of the `cat` output vectors and `dog` output vectors to get `cat` and `dog` class centers. These class centers are referred to as **C<sub>yi</sub>** in Eq 1. Therefore, for every feature **X<sub>i</sub>**, the loss becomes it's distance from it's class center **C<sub>yi</sub>**. The closer the feature **X<sub>i</sub>** is to it's class center  **C<sub>yi</sub>**, the lower the loss and vice-versa. 

I hope at this stage Center Loss is intuitively very clear to the reader. If it isn't then either I haven't explained it simply enough or I kindly ask the reader to go through the example above once more. 

The main contributions of the paper were: 
- New loss function (called center loss) to minimize the intra-class distances of the deep features.
- Proposed loss function is very easy to implement in the CNNs.
- New state-of-the-art under the evaluation protocol of small training set on [Megaface Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02108).

## Center Loss: The Proposed Approach
As mentioned before, intuitively, minimizing the intra-class variations while keeping the features of different classes separable is the key.

Therefore the authors proposed a new loss function called Center Loss as below:

![](/images/center_loss.png "eq-1 Center Loss")

This Center Loss makes sure that all features are as close to their class centers as possible. Therefore, they become more discriminative.

There is one performance issue with Center Loss though. Ideally, the class centers should be updated every time the deep features are changed (that is, with every training iteration). In other words, we need to take the entire training set into account and average the features of every class in each iteration, which is inefficient even impractical. Therefore, the center loss can not be used directly.

Therefore, to address this problem the authors proposed a two necessary modifications: 
1. Instead of updating the centers with respect to the entire training set, we perform the update based on mini-batch. 
2. In each iteration, the centers are computed by averaging the features of the corresponding classes (In this case, some of the centers may not update as they might not be present in the mini-batch)

In other words, rather than going through the training set image by image, go through a set of mini-batches and continue updating the class centers by taking the averages of the features for each class in the mini batch.

Also, the authors used joint supervision to train the CNNs for discriminative feature learning. That is, they used a combination of Softmax loss and Center Loss like so:

![](/images/join_supervision.png "eq-3 Joint Supervision")

Here, 
L<sub>S</sub> refers to as Softmax Loss ; L<sub>C</sub> refers to as Center Loss

This keeps the training more stable and also the learned features are more discriminative as compared to Softmax Loss. From the paper: 

![](/images/center_loss_ftrs.png "fig-3 MNIST test features w Center Loss")

Here, as mentioned `λ` is a hyperparameter that is used for balancing the two loss functions. 

We can see in the image above, now the trained features are more discriminative and also separable as compared to the feature distribution when compared to Softmax Loss. There are more closely formed clusters and this is what metric learning aims to do - minimizing the intra-class variations while keeping the features of different classes separable.

## Center Loss: Code Implementation 
A complete notebook on how to train a network with Center Loss has been shared [here](https://github.com/amaarora/amaarora.github.io/blob/master/nbs/Understanding%20Metric%20Learning.ipynb) along with plots to showcase the difference with Softmax Loss.

## Conclusion
I hope that today, I was able to provide a concise and easy to digest explaination of the Center Loss and also introduce Metric Learning to the reader.
